          <h2>About </h2>
          <p class="lead">Recent advances in Natural Language Processing, and the emergence of pretrained Large Language Models (LLM) specifically, have made NLP systems omnipresent in various aspects of our everyday life. In addition to traditional examples such as personal voice assistants, recommender systems, etc, more recent developments include content-generation models such as ChatGPT, text-to-image models (Dall-E), and so on. While these emergent technologies have an unquestionable potential to power various innovative NLP and AI applications, they also pose a number of challenges in terms of their safe and ethical use. To address such challenges, NLP researchers have formulated various objectives, e.g., intended to make models more fair, safe, and privacy-preserving. However, these objectives are often considered separately, which is a major limitation since it is often important to understand the interplay and/or tension between them. For instance, meeting a fairness objective might require access to users’ demographic information, which creates tension with privacy objectives. The goal of this workshop is to move toward a more comprehensive notion of Trustworthy NLP, by bringing together researchers working on those distinct yet related topics, as well as their intersection.

		 <h2>Invited Talk</h2>
<h3> Hal Daumé III: Trust in the Absence of Verifiability </h3>
		<p>		When NLP systems, in particular large language models, generate claims that are easily verified by people to be untrue, trust is irrelevant. What matters is when they generate claims that are not (easily) verified to be true. Which raises two questions: (1) How much complementarity is there between what LLMs "know" and what people do, and (2) Can LLMs themselves provide missing complementary information. I'll discuss some good news and bad news that provide partial answers to these questions.
		</p>
		<p>
		Hal Daumé III is a Volpi-Cupal Endowed Professor in Computer Science and Language Science at the University of Maryland, College Park; he has a joint appointment as a Senior Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research, New York City. His primary research interest is in developing new learning algorithms for prototypical problems that arise in the context of natural language processing and artificial intelligence, with a focus on interactive learning and understanding and minimizing social harms that can be caused or exacerbated by computational systems. He has received several awards, including best paper at AACL 2022, WMT 2020, ACL 2018, NAACL 2016, CEAS 2011 and ECML 2009, as well as best demo at NeurIPS 2015. He has been program chair for ICML 2020 (together with Aarti Singh) and for NAACL 2013 (together with Katrin Kirchhoff), and he was an inaugural diversity and inclusion co-chair at NeurIPS 2018 (with Katherine Heller).

<h3> Ramprasaath R. Selvaraju: Empowering Human-like Decision Making in AI Models through Explanations </h3>
<p>		Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable results in several Computer Vision tasks, but their increasing complexity poses challenges in terms of interpretability. In this talk, I will present my research on explainability in deep learning models, ranging from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to multi-modal transformers, for tasks ranging from static image analysis to active perception, and demonstrate how it can enhance their human-likeness. I will focus on how interpretability can establish user trust, identify failure modes, provide targeted human feedback, debias models, ground representations, and facilitate compositional reasoning. Lastly, I will discuss future research directions. Ultimately, my talk aims to underscore the importance of interpretability in AI and its potential to advance the development of trustworthy, robust, and human-like machine learning models.
</p>
<p> Ramprasaath is a Scientist at Apple TDG (Technology Development Group). Prior to this, he was a Sr. Research Scientist at Salesforce. He holds a PhD in Computer Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he was advised by Devi Parikh and Dhruv Batra. His research lies at the intersection of computer vision, explainable AI and multi-modal pretraining. Specifically, his research focuses on building algorithms that provide explanations for decisions emanating from deep networks in order to build user trust, incorporate domain knowledge into AI, and correct for unwanted biases learned by deep AI models. Previously, he has held visiting positions at Brown, Oxford, Virginia Tech, Facebook, Samsung, Tesla and Microsoft. He obtained his Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering and his Master's degree in Physics from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani.</p>	
	
<h3> 		Rachel Rudinger: Trustworthy Commonsense Inference for NLP </h3>
<p>
		We use language to communicate about real-world situations, so it follows that trustworthy NLP systems ought to have basic knowledge of and ability to reason about real-world situations. Imbuing NLP systems with “common sense” requires models to learn useful generalizations about the world while avoiding the pitfalls of overgeneralization. In this talk, I will discuss a number of cases where models overgeneralize in ways that harm robustness and fairness. I will discuss work on uncovering these failure modes, as well as identifying their root causes.
</p>
		<p>Rachel Rudinger is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park. She holds joint appointments in the Department of Linguistics and the Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS). In 2019, Rachel completed her Ph.D. in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University in the Center for Language and Speech Processing. From 2019-2020, she was a Young Investigator at the Allen Institute for AI in Seattle, and a visiting researcher at the University of Washington. Her research interests include computational semantics, common-sense reasoning, and issues of social bias and fairness in NLP. </p>
	
	<h3> Sunipa Dev: Contextualizing Evaluations with Cross Cultural Perspectives </h3>
	<p>
		Evaluation of language models rely heavily on semi-structured data annotated by humans. Both the data and human perspectives involved in the process, thus play a key role in what is taken as ground truth by models. Historically, this perspective has been Western-oriented which leads to a lack of representation of global contexts and identities in models as well as evaluation strategies, and the risk of disregarding marginalized groups that are most significantly affected by implicit harms. Accounting for cross-cultural differences in interacting with technology is an important step for building and evaluating AI holistically.  We will talk through different strategies including community engaged approaches, along with survey experiments to capture a more diverse set of perspectives in data curation and benchmarking efforts. We will also zoom in on how socio-culturally aware AI research can fill in the gaps in fairness evaluations.
	</p>
	<p>
		Sunipa Dev is a Research Scientist at Google at their Responsible AI and Human Centered Technologies organization. She works at the intersection of language and society, trying to push the frontiers of inclusivity, equity, and representation in language technologies, and making them more socio-culturally aware. Some of her current work investigates what representation means across languages and cultures, and how to make emerging technologies more useful across the globe. Her work has received awards such as the NSF Computing Innovation Fellowship, and she was named as one of '100 Brilliant Women in AI Ethics' in 2022. She is also passionate about inclusivity in opportunities in NLP and is a core organizer of Widening NLP.
